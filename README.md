# Master-Thesis
In this repository you can find all the code used in the simulations and modelling of behind master thesis "Explaining Grid Cell Activity in One Spatial Dimension by Hippocampal Activity Correlations" (click [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330738714_Master_Thesis_Explaining_Grid_Cell_Activity_in_One_Spatial_Dimension_by_Hippocampal_Activity_Correlations) to access the thesis).

Note: I am working to make the content as clear as possible. However, due to the background needed and the highly specific content, the code might be quite tough to understand. I am adding further comments and erasing unnecesary parts. A Jupyter Notebook version might be released soon.
